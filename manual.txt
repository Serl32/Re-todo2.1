Re-ToDo2.1 Version - 2.1.1
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 

A Simple ToDo Program written in C. And initializes Apache Cassandra/SQLite database to store the information and data.
+ Currently the program uses txt/JSON files to store, retrive and log the data. The initialization of these files may be handled by the C Program itself.
Or may be for simplicity and easier accesibility the program will use a bash script file to generate the data and log files.
* It's still under consideration either to use the script file to install/Compile and set-up the program or to run the script from the C Program to set-up files.
* This program will use script file to compile and run this program from the terminal.
* This program was first planned to be build or store data in txt files because of the complexity. However it was found easier to store and retrive,
And also manage the data with a database. The program uses SQLite embedded database to store the data.
* The source code for the main.c was corrupted while compiling with the wrong file name. Had to re-write the main.c file again.

#   USER GUIDE AND DOCUMENTATION/MANUALS
    ./[PROGRAM NAME][FLAGS AS ARGUMENTS]
    //Change the program to however the user desire in the install.sh.
    
    -h  -   [arg] help/Displays MANUALS
    -l  -   [arg] lists logs - Located in the data/ from the current directory.
    -n  -   [arg] Create New ToDo.

    -c  -   [arg][ID] Complete a ToDo with a ID as another argument to mark the ToDo Completed.

    * Make sure to wrap the text in double quotes if it contains spaces!

    Use "init" argument to create new database.

#   NOTES
    * The data files will be stored in the current directory or in the users home directory or in the current files directory in data/.
    * If you change the files location in the install.sh file, make sure to also change the file location the in C Program code and then re-complie and C Program.
        Or run the script again.
    * You can set the environment variables or use the program from the programs directory.
    * This is just for the fun project for productivity and managing the simple tasks and learning C Program.
